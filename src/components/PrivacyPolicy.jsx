        <p>
          YIMA Mobile Protect's work conforms to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the South African Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) when processing personal data. This means we:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clearly specify our purposes before we process personal data by using this privacy statement.</li>
          <li>Limit our collection of personal data to only the personal data needed for legitimate purposes.</li>
          <li>First, ask for explicit permission to process your personal data in cases where your permission is required.</li>
          <li>Take appropriate security measures to protect your personal data, and we demand the same from parties who process personal data on our behalf.</li>
          <li>Respect your right to access, correct or delete your personal data held by us.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          YIMA Mobile Protect (formal company name: Intersense Co., Ltd.) is responsible for all data processing. This privacy statement explains what personal data we collect and for what purposes. We recommend that you read it carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have any questions regarding the processing of personal data, the contact details of Intersense Co., Ltd. are at the end of this privacy statement.
        </p>

        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>
          Certain features of our service may require you to register beforehand. You will have to provide some information about yourself and choose a username and password for the account we will set up for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this purpose, we will gather your name and address details, email address, profile picture, city, country, and language. We need this data to fulfill our obligations under the agreement with you. We store this information for a limited period until you close your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will retain this data so that you do not have to re-enter it every time you use our website or mobile application, to contact you in connection with the execution of the agreement, invoicing, and payment (insofar relevant), and to provide an overview of the products and services you have purchased from us.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          You may contact us via email, social media, or our contact form. All the personal data which is included in your correspondence with us will be used to provide you with a fitting response or to comply with your request. We store this data for as long as needed for the purposes you have contacted us.
        </p>

        <h2>Promotion</h2>
        <p>
          We may inform you about new products or services via e-mail or push notifications. You can object at all times against this promotional communication. Every email or push notification contains a cancellation link.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>
          Our website and mobile application may show advertisements. We collaborate with advertising partners who may collect non-identifiable data, such as device information or usage data, to show relevant ads. For details, please refer to their respective privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Phone Number Verification Feature</h2>
        <p>
          Our website and mobile app offer a feature that allows visitors to crosscheck phone numbers against a database of numbers potentially connected to scams. This service is designed to help users identify and avoid fraudulent activities. The database may be composed of third-party sources, each with their own data categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use this feature, we collect the phone number you input for the sole purpose of performing the crosscheck. We do not store this phone number after the check is complete, nor do we share it with third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you believe that a phone number has been unjustly included in the database, you may submit a removal request as described in the "Your Rights" section.
        </p>

        <h2>Providing Data to Third-Parties</h2>
        <p>
          Except for the parties necessary to deliver the above-mentioned services, we do not, under any circumstance, provide your personal data to other companies or organisations unless we are required to do so by law (for example, when law enforcement demands access in case of a suspected crime).
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website and mobile application may contain social media buttons or third-party links. These providers may collect your personal data. Please refer to their privacy policies for further information.
        </p>

        <h2>How Advertisers Track</h2>
        <p>
          Our website and mobile application may use cookies and similar technologies to improve user experience. Cookies are small files that store information to help remember your preferences or identify returning visitors. You can disable cookies through your browser settings, but some parts of our website may not work correctly as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our mobile application, we may use SDKs, APIs, or device identifiers to support analytics, advertising, and functionality. Users can reset their advertising IDs through their device settings. These partners may include Google, Meta, and other trusted third-party providers.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take strict security measures to reduce misuse and unauthorised access to personal data. We renew our security measures regularly to ensure the safe storage of personal data and keep track of potential vulnerabilities.
